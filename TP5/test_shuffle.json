( ene ) .\nsome of their reluctance stems from the fact that the looming deal reported by dow jones newswires has yet to be confirmed by the two houston energy trading companies .\nmore worrisome however is the possibility that enron - already crippled by an equity probe and a restatement of four years of earnings - may have even deeper woes to report .\n unless enron is providing significantly more disclosure to the buyer than to the rest of the world i don t see how a buyer could get comfortable . said an arbitrageur with a new york hedge fund .\nwhat worries takeover traders is the likelihood that any agreement would likely have extensive material adverse change or mac clauses providing plenty of room for dynergy to exit the deal should more problems arise at enron .\n as an investor it s hard for me to own something when i don t know what it is said the arbitrageur of enron . i take some comfort that someone is stepping up the plate but that s not enough for me . \nanother arbitrageur added if it gets announced it s a deal with a lot of issues starting with who bears the risk if enron has a lot of lawsuits because of alleged accounting fraud . \naccording to the wall street journal dynergy will swap nearly 0 . 27 of a share of its stock for each share of enron . also under the deal chevrontexaco corp . ( cvx ) which owns 26 % of dynergy will make an immediate cash injection of $ 1 . 5 billion into the deal and then add another billion on closing .\nshares of dynergy jumped more than 10 % in heavy trading bolstered by the idea that the company is picking up enron for a steal . carry shares traded recently at $ 39 . 61 up $ 3 . 06 a share .\nan acquirer s shares typically fall after a deal has been announced in part because arbitrageurs sell the shares short while going long the target . in this case however arbitrageurs are largely on the sidelines which is perhaps alleviating some of the downside pressure on dynergy .\nenron meanwhile traded about 4 % higher recently swapping hands at $ 8 . 77 a share in heavy volume . the stock was buoyed by the reported bid from dynergy as well as a new credit rating from moody s . the firm downgraded enron s rating a notch to just above speculative not as bad as the junk rating some had feared .\ncopyright ?

based utilicorp announced today it is buying back the 20 percent of its trading subsidiary aquila that it spun off in an initial public offering just last spring .\npart of the reason sources say is that aquila has been trying to acquire assets from enron in the last couple of weeks but couldn t get the credit it needed because energy trading and power - producing companies have been shut out of the equity markets since the enron meltdown began .\nother energy trading companies have been measuring their exposure to enron but have been vague about disclosing their risk say easterbrook and dingmann .\nsome industry watchers say a merger between enron and dynegy would catch intense anti - trust scrutiny from the ftc and the justice department while others disagree .\ntheir physical assets don t overlap and there would be no market limitations on their trading operations maintains john sodergreen editor and publisher of scudder online energy trade publications .\none insider believes lay has no intention of selling enron and that while he may have his back against a wall he is still in a position to dictate terms to dynegy because of that company s exposed position . this source sees enron surviving with chevron holding a big chunk of it as well as a bigger piece of dynegy .\n chevron could be the real winner here this pundit theorizes .\ndynegy may acquire enron for $ 22 bln in stock debt ( update 6 )\n2001 -

parties continue to trade with it he said . ` ` if\nthat goes away it becomes a precarious situation which is\nsomething that has been pretty clear to the market for awhile . \nthe energy trader last week had its long -

trading units :\n` ` one of the reasons that we decided to exit the trading\nsector was that the barriers to entry were few . \n` ` if you go back 15 years ago transcanada had a 100 percent\nshare of the gas that was exported from alberta other than the\nvolume that went to california . as the market opened enron was\none of the earliest to enter but certainly many others have\nentered over time . \n",
